And Bec Rack here. Today we're talking about five ways to have that winning attitude. You know, having a winning attitude is obviously essential to being successful. Theodore Roosevelt once said, Believe you can and you are halfway there. A lot of times we end up defeating ourselves before we begin by having a negative outlook on what is going on. We sometimes tend to look at opportunities and only see those roadblocks, or we only see the glass half empty as opposed to half full. One of the most interesting quotes that I've ever heard is what was once said by John F. Kennedy. When written in Chinese, the word crisis is composed of two characters. One represents danger and the other represents opportunity. So having a winning attitude is really all about how we view the world around us. It can be very easy to only see problems when we face hard times and new challenges, and yet the most successful people in the world have always shown that outlook plays a huge part in how successful you actually are. So how can you have a winning attitude even in the face of adversity? Well, let me share five tips that might point you in the right direction. Following these five tips will get you well on your way to defeating that negative frame of mind that threatens or dampens your spirits and discourages you when times get tough. The first one is think about your strong points. A quick assessment of your strong points can often be enough to deter some negative thoughts, especially if you allow yourself to be honest. As a successful professional, you have a wide range of qualities that you deserve to be very proud of, and part of having that winning attitude is about focusing on your strong points as opposed to your weaknesses. Lueholtz said, ability is what you're capable of doing. Motivation determines what you do. Attitude determines how well you do it. Number two, give yourself a daily pep talk. Sometimes the strongest positive voice is your own. Take some time each day to look into the mirror and give yourself a well-deserved pep talk. Tell yourself that you can do anything you set your mind to and remind yourself to just not give up. Some people have affirmations they say out loud every day that makes a big difference for how they start and finish their day. It might sound a bit cheesy, but building confidence and a winning attitude is going to require you believe in yourself, and one of the best ways to accomplish this is to speak it out loud. Number three, listen to motivational speakers. Believe it or not, there are some very powerful motivational speakers out there who can really help you to see the good in things going around you. Two of my favorite speakers are Zig Ziglar and Jim Rohn, and there are a lot of others that can be very helpful to listen to. Listening to a good motivational speaker can help you fill your mind with positive thoughts and can help you to see reasons for believing in yourself that you might not notice on your own. Number four, remind yourself that anything is possible. It can be easy to feel like you're not capable of accomplishing difficult or enormous feats, but you will soon realize that the only thing separating you from victory is a winning attitude. Simple logic tells that if you continue to try without giving up, you truly can accomplish anything you desire. We sometimes feel like we can only do so much, or that we're only capable of doing certain things. But, limiting yourself by not having the drive to try, despite possible failure, will hold you back more than anyone else possibly could. Susan Barnes said, the keys to success, pure staying power, persistence, continually believing in something, dogged stubbornness to get things done, and continual optimism. Number five, live victoriously. Living life as if you already know what your next endeavor will be is a success in exactly what it looks like to embody a winning attitude. Consider yourself a winner before the project even starts. Never assume that you're going to fail. If failure does come, realize that you have not lost. You have just realized one way that your plan didn't work. It's okay to occasionally have a five minute pity party and then put your big girl or big boy pants on and move on. Fail and error is part of winning, so never feel like you do not have what it takes to go to your next level. Live life like you are a winner, every single day, and it will definitely show. Having a winning attitude is essential, even though very few people have mastered this art. To do this, you need to have passion for what you're doing, a strong belief in yourself and your abilities, a strategy you believe in, values that are clearly defined, and a mastery over your outlook. Once you've mastered the art of maintaining a winning attitude day in and day out, you will begin to realize that only boundaries imposed upon you are those that you impose upon yourself. In a lot of ways, becoming more successful is not about being lucky or fortunate. It's about taking the circumstances that you're in and turning them into opportunities. Robert Williams said, you can do 99% of things right, but not possess a winning attitude, and you will fail. What you can imagine is what your potential is and what your possibilities are. Set your intention and choose to live the life that you really want. You know what? Many billionaires do imagination work every day. They imagine what they want for a very few minutes every single day as a consistent habit. You can do exactly the same thing to help you accelerate your results in business and in life.
