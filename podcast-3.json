Also tonight new images from inside the home of the suspected Gilgo Beach serial killer. His family now threatening to sue police for the condition they left the home in after their search. Here's Stephanie Goss. Attorneys for Rex Hearman's family say investigators left the alleged serial killer's home unlivable. They can't be inside. The house is in shambles. It's ransacked. The dishes inside are deplorable. The family is considering a lawsuit. Today lawyers released new photos of the home including evidence boxes piled high and missing drain pipes in the bathroom. The police department said it does not comment on pending litigation. A lawyer for Hearman's wife also made a public appeal for money to help the family. Asa Elarup who filed for divorce has cancer he says and the insurance is running out. Rex Hearman pleaded not guilty. Does his family believe him? The only thing his family knows about these charges has been reported to the media. But do they think he did it? We haven't had that conversation. Frankly it doesn't matter. I need to get Asa back to be mentally healthy. Rex Hearman is accused of killing three women over a decade ago and is linked to the disappearance of a fourth according to the Long Island prosecutor. Hello and welcome to Real Crime Profile. I'm Lisa Zambetti. I'm a casting director for CBS's Criminal Minds and with me today is. Laura Richards, criminal behavioural analyst, former New Scotland Yard, founder of Paladin National Stalking Advocacy Service, author of the book Policing Domestic Violence and host of the podcast Crime Analyst. I'm Jim Clemente, retired FBI profile, former New York City prosecutor and writer producer of Criminal Minds. So today we're finishing our conversation about what the media has called the Long Island serial killer and we understand all too well the fascination with the suspect that's in custody but we're also focusing our attention on the Long Island serial killings. We continue to focus on the victims, how they died and Jim and Laura's take on the behaviour of the person who may have killed them and why it's taken so long, over 10 years, to bring a suspect into custody. So let's jump right back into our conversation. So I would imagine we will hear more about his coercive and controlling behaviour. People are asking me that a lot and I have just learned that his first wife, he was married before she left him because he was abusive to her. I don't know the detail of that but I would expect far more to be coming out but with Asa I just feel, you know, she's just in the headlights and is absolutely traumatised and Kerry talked to me about the trauma that happens when you get that knock on the door as she got and she said it was a guy who claimed to be from the FBI, he was but he was just an accountant but he told her the news and then he wanted to do a swab, which he did and gave her... Wait, an accountant? He apparently said that he was from the accounting side, he wasn't a field agent. Why was he doing a buccal swab? Well, it's a good question Jim. She did keep his card but she never heard from him again and she was just left with that and the same with the mum. They were all taken off and separated and obviously interviewed but that was the first and the last time, there was no follow-up and they were just left trying to deal with, they weren't offered any victim services for example. Now that's going back in time and I would hope that that's changed. In the UK we have family liaison officers that get put in to either side of the families depending but there are services there but Kerry said she didn't receive any of that and she's still in therapy now and of course she's still called, we talked about legacy in the last episode, she's called in the media and by others BTK's daughter, which I can't bear. Imagine being named as the worst acts that your father committed and that legacy is what you are now known by and are known across your whole life as the worst acts that your father did, almost as if you are accountable and that's what I really just don't like about the media chasing down Asa because she is accessible that they feel it's okay to ask her to account for his behaviour and to me that's not okay. The only people who should be interviewing her are the FBI or the agents or investigators involved in the case at this stage and I do hope that they bring in someone who's trained in coercive control and that's really important because the language is codified and oftentimes as we've talked about so many times victims don't realise that what they've been experiencing isn't healthy and it's not normal and they need help to understand what's gone on and how they're left completely baffled and their world being upended. That's what I wonder Laura if the pennies are dropping now for her, if she doesn't know what she knows, that she's starting to realise things that she actually does know and I mean the pictures I've heard she looks so vulnerable in such a horrible state but I wanted to ask you both before we end and I'm going to ask you to take a big swing with this and speculate that so much attention has been towards this his basement and as you say this soundproof or whatever this room is that he had built. In your expertise do you think that he used it as on criminal minds we would call it a kill room that he could possibly have held people there, held these women there or killed them there or do you think it's more likely that he met them outside the house and killed them in his car or somewhere else and closer to where he got rid of their bodies? I mean the thing for me is that someone of this psychology of this nature they want to spend time with the victims so this isn't just a quick contact offence this is somebody who wants to enact their fantasies so therefore they have to have a place to take them to right. I don't believe it's going to happen in a car or somewhere where you're exposed and you're outside maybe the earlier ones and I know Jim will have a view on this but I certainly don't know any serial killers who started in their fourth decade of life if we row back to when the bodies you know when the women went missing he probably would have been what late 40s 46 something like that so there will be other offences before that so there may be somewhere he watched and peeped or did other things but in terms of the fantasy and what he really wants to do to them he needs to have a place and a space where he feels he is in control and he's not going to be interrupted so there's every likelihood and what I've learned about the vault is that it wasn't just that there were guns in there apparently it was cluttered there was room for other things there was potentially a mattress in there I don't know that hasn't been confirmed 100% but apparently there were other things in there it wasn't just a gun vault and it would not surprise me if that's where he took some of the victims given that his wife was out of town across some of the times where the women disappeared when they've timelines they know for sure that she was out of town equally did he take them into the house and I would imagine and I'm sure Jim will have a view on this too that's why it's been upended so badly Dennis Raider for example told Bob Morton and colleagues exactly where to find certain things so they didn't upend the house and destroy the house but in this case they're looking for everything and anything that could be potential evidence so in my view Lisa you know and it's not just speculation it's just the fact that someone of this nature and psychology and psychopathology wants to spend as much time with the victims and he's into torture you know so I believe it's it's likely Jim yeah I think you're right about that Laura especially the part about wanting to spend time with them also planning to spend time with them because he fantasized about this and he knew he has every intention of killing them he knew he was going to kill them so it wouldn't be a problem bringing them to his house so that that is a very high probability if not his house then the storage areas or some other place because typically they will transport their victims to a place where they have more privacy and control and so of course in a basement in a locked chamber with a steel door and concrete they would have a lot of privacy and control and so I think that is a high probability I would also be looking for I mean the the configuration of that vehicle the Chevy Avalanche is that you could actually make the bed of the truck open to the seats seating area of the truck in other words you can make it like a modified SUV or a pickup truck you could have either either configuration and if he had that configuration that he could access it the back of the truck the the bed of the truck I think he could have he certainly could have used it and probably used it to transport the bodies but he could have used it also in a garage or in another area a private area that he had control of to sexually assault and or kill victims so I think both of those areas are going to be a high probability and I know that he purchased property in New Jersey in his daughter's name I don't know if if she lived there all the time or if he purchased it while she was still young and living at home I don't know those facts yet but there are definitely other places that have to be searched and I hope that in all of the documents and electronic information that they that they seized that they'll be able to find ancillary locations if they don't find forensic evidence and proof that he committed these crimes in his house yeah and just one other point I wanted to pick up because there's a lot of talk around on this when people talk about hiatus is you know when someone's not offending you know I had a conversation with with Kerry about that with her father and she doesn't believe they were hiatus is you know she just believes he hasn't been timeline accurately and I believe that too given the nature of how prolific offenders are we only know what we know and if we don't ask we'll never know but you got to know what you're asking for and I think oftentimes as I learned from Kerry the fact that it was never followed up with her and her mother to timeline what their knowledge and him and bearing in mind that he traveled a lot went hiking with them and did all these different activities well it's multi-states that should be looked at when time lining him and we know that with Rex Heuerman as well which makes it a vast investigation and timeline but oftentimes I do hear investigators and profilers talk about hiatus is as if they're absolute that he stopped offending but that's not my experience is that we're just not understanding how prolific people are aware to look and these are very time intensive and resource intensive investigations as well aren't they with someone like Rex Heuerman I mean Jim when how would you go back in terms of his timeline where would you start because we know he didn't start in his 40s. No you should be starting in his late adolescence and see those precursor crimes and then the development of relationships and what happened with his first wife and why she left him and then you know there's going to be it's almost guaranteed there's going to be other crimes that he committed that he got away with that nobody even knew that the crime was committed and you know when you are as a serial killer pick on the less dead I think you called them the people who society forgets about homeless people hitchhikers sex workers those people are not missed sometimes and so this is why. Not even reported missing. Right. Not even reported missing as we know with Karen Vergata's case. Or that law enforcement disregards them because they can be a you know mobile or nomadic population that they just assume that nothing really happened they just moved on they were drug addicts they were sex workers they were hitchhikers whatever they probably just ran away they probably just moved on that unfortunately allows these offenders who target them for exactly those reasons because of their vulnerability and because of the lack of accountability when when they go missing because of that they are the easiest for these kinds of offenders to prey on. I hope that that they are seriously looking way back I mean at least 30 years into his background because I do believe that somebody who's that sophisticated and you know in the years probably between 1999 years and the first 20 years of the 2000s I think all of those all those time frames he was old enough and motivated enough to be committing those kinds of crimes. Yeah and he obviously thought he was very good at doing what he was doing with the seven burner phones and the Tinder profiles and Amex and hiding the car you know there's a lot of this thought that's gone into avoiding apprehension and that's why the bail application was so thorough and you're right Jim I mean the in 2011 the chief of detectives at the time gave a press conference and he said that it's a consolation that the murderer is not selecting citizens at large is selecting from a pool so that's codified behavior for well he's selecting people who aren't really high value so us good folk we don't have to worry because we're not at risk is how that subtext works. Don't worry people in public don't worry because he's only picking on. These women many of them were moms and they certainly were daughters and sisters and people loved them and were worried about them. I mean for me I always talk about the fact you know because we hear people say well she's someone's daughter or she's someone's mom but I always say well she's someone. Right she's someone and that matters in and of itself and that again played into the lack of urgency and the leadership issue but it was very obvious it was like the Peter Sutcliffe case in the UK with the you know the victims just weren't seen and the misogyny really played in as well and the misogyny the bros codified you know language and network and unfortunately what that does is green light someone like Rex Heuerman and oftentimes we hear well they were very sophisticated they were just so good and so clever at what they did that's why it's so hard but actually as I always say you get the basics right the rest will follow and it's really important in investigations like this how many other women have been harmed because someone didn't do their damn job and that's what it boils down to at the end of the day for me corruption and male egos and that prevented him from being identified far earlier on and we don't know how many victims there are we don't know the horror that Asa had to live through we don't we certainly I get the sense that he felt he was untouchable that he had done all of the things that he had done but there were some things that were quite sloppy and we're going to hear more about that with the court case and of course Jim and Lisa I'm always slightly guarded against not putting too much information out there because this is how people learn we know that serial killers follow these sorts of cases they follow the podcast just like human did just like Dennis Raider did who was a big true crime fan did you know that Jim he was really into true crime and read all the books etc so they all want to be the the serial killer that's not caught and they all want to learn that's why we have to be slightly guarded about not putting everything out there because who else are we educating right and you know obviously the reason one of the major reasons why they talk to us at the BAU when we do the research studies is because they want to go down in history you know they're so you know needy they're vulnerable narcissists and and they they need to feel like they're important and they want to be in the news and I think this asshole when he was arrested asked is this in the news is being covered and you know there's his there's his ego the first thing he said yes is it in the news now of course you could play devil's advocate and say well he wanted to know because did his wife know already but I suspect it's much more about am I in the news because this is you know the most important thing I've done with my life that the thing for me is that they're all very ordinary individuals yeah who do horrific things and that's why we always talk about not giving them their monikers particularly those that are self-appointed don't make them bigger than and you know don't buy the t-shirts with their faces on it or use you know these monikers the family members know what was done to them yeah yeah it still happens you know Halloween costumes like Ted Bundy it's still happening even now and people think that serial killers this is fun and exciting and entertainment but you know these women were tortured it was sadistic behavior he played out these fantasies and it would have been incredibly painful and there's nothing fun or exciting or you know entertaining about murder but yes we want we want to study it as Jim and I have done because we want to understand and get into intervention and prevention want to put those lessons out there right of how we identify these men far earlier and protect people but in the main you know where we're going down the track of true crime it's just become this fun sort of spectacle and entertaining and we have to be very careful and that's why real crime profile we do want to center the victims and make sure we have conversations that educate in the right way right yeah and you know I couldn't even watch the the series that came out recently that they're saying is acclaimed about an offender or there's also a dramatic one that's out now that's about an offender and you know I just it's not entertainment to me I don't understand how how it's so popular people when when you know what they should really be learning about is is the victim ology right but as David Fincher would say you know we we stare at these monsters because we don't understand them and we want to understand them but sometimes we stare at them because we feel that they are a part of us there's some latent psychopathy in us so there is a fascination to it and I I mean hey I worked on a show that was all about serial killers you know and I I made money off of that so what can I say you know if we didn't have the audience I wouldn't have had a job so I feel conflicted that I don't want to glorify murder or suffering or trauma but yeah but that show never did have often called criminal minds torture porn you know but that's some people who were involved in it and did had no idea what it actually was because there was no torture porn there was no regaling in in the bad guy it was all about saving someone in the end it was all about stopping people from being victimized yeah but we certainly showed a lot of trauma we certainly showed a lot of people being tortured we did I mean I I cast those roles and right but yeah but wait we didn't show it we suggested it we didn't we had this was a network TV show and we we never showed torture we showed people in situations that they got tortured but we didn't show the torture and and many times people say oh it was such a bloody and gory show well no actually it wasn't that's your imagination filling in the blanks because there were very strict standards from standards and practices about what network shows are about to are allowed to depict but we may have not shown it explicitly talked about women underneath rocks being crushed and we saw people get you know on the brink of being hurt I mean right and it's something that you really have to think about and you know David we loved the series mind hunter but it's certainly you know it's certainly focused on a lot of those serial killers so yeah but it focused on the reality the it was meant to educate people about things that happened it wasn't just a fantasy where you know hey let's make up some really bizarre bad things I mean I made an effort and every single one of those criminal minds episodes to make sure that there were real teaching points from real cases and even though the case might not be what that episode was based on the teaching points and the learning that and educating the public that was all based on real work that that we did in in the BAU yeah and there are ways of showing these things and and I agree it's I was thinking about to all the episodes I'd watch of criminal minds it's the suggestion of it and your mind goes to much darker places actually the suggestion of it but I think there is a way of doing it but it's a very fine line and that you know the word monsters because I keep hearing Rex Hulman being talked to you know as if he is a monster well they hide in plain sight because they are just like us and they're very chameleon esque that's one thing Kerry said about her father he was very chameleon esque he could read emotional temperatures incredibly well and I you know I was nodding away to her this is a crime analyst interview I was just nodding away hearing her describe how he was in their relationship and so on but you would just overlook him if he were in a crowd of people because he just looks so ordinary I mean Rex Hulman is this hulking you know Frankenstein type ogre I mean he's huge he stands out that's why I'd be expecting to hear more you know about these creepy encounters that people have and we'll be learning far more you know about his behaviour and I do feel that the evidence we've heard thus far is just a fraction of what they've got as Jim knows you don't put everything in the Bale application they choose time codes of data very specifically I would imagine there's a huge amount more to come but yes framing these men as monsters it means that their wives don't see them for who they are we want people to be thinking about their coercive and controlling behaviour because that's what I've seen in common talking to John White Jim and you and Fitz and so many other of the behavioural profilers at the BAU when I was there and we were talking about control related behaviours and domestic abuse and there wasn't one case, Barr, Dennis Rader that's why for me that was always the one that stood out yeah where I kept being told there was no history he hadn't done anything within his family setting when there was just so much there yeah that now you know for me it makes much more sense now in that knowledge so understanding what those warning signs look like and educating people it's really important we can community-wise close down perpetrators communities hold perpetrators to account too of what's acceptable and what's not you know so someone like Dennis Rader there were lawsuits against him when he was a compliance officer women reporting him for peeping and being aggressive to them and harassing them and stalking them they had made formal complaints and the supervisors just buried those lawsuits but there are always these warning signs it's you've got to know what to look for and I think our knowledge is far more superior now and ever-evolving for me when people say it's such a surprise this individual he's not a surprise to me at all and he's not a surprise to Jim because Jim wrote the profile in 2011 and it's pretty much spot-on on every point his behavior screamed out the kind of person he was and it's just unfortunate like you said that that politics and corruption made it drag on so long all I wonder is what was he doing in those years were there other victims because of that well the timeline that will reveal what he was doing where he was doing how he was doing it and even though he thinks he's been very clever there's lots of leakage here so time will tell but that's always the issue with homicide prevention and violence prevention there are these opportunities to stop someone and that's what I spend a lot of my time being laser focused on of how do we understand these individuals and disrupt them earlier on and I do wish Jim I could you know remove the male ego in the officers who work these cases because I think ego is just getting the way all of the time and that's one of the biggest barriers I think to joint collaborative working and to finding these individuals I believe you I mean it is something you've seen it you know it Jim we all know behind the scenes what goes on it's just no one ever wants to talk about it on record wall of it yeah yeah it's very frustrating but for the good officers who want to get shit done and you know being held back it's incredibly frustrating being told to stand down off leads or not prioritize certain things and go chase waste time somewhere else when you want to follow something that you know is very important but time will tell you know for now I think about the victims still some who haven't been identified in this case you know there's a toddler there's a woman who's known and identified only as peaches because of a tattoo that's on her breast you know we've still got victims with body parts without names and that's just so dehumanizing you know and people say well do you think he'll talk well we've got a whole trial first of all and he's saying he's innocent and his lawyer is saying they've got to grow their defense team because they've got so much material and they're gonna have their day in court and even if he's convicted he's probably still not going to talk because there's gonna be most likely an appeal we know how it goes right Jim and then maybe down the line maybe he will. Does New York have the death penalty Jim? I don't remember. It doesn't. No maximum life without parole so there's not really much that can be done in terms of plea deals etc and Jim actually just one last word from you because this is curious to me and I'm sure it will be to our listeners CODIS and DNA so there's murmurings first of all that there's been a request for his DNA that they want what I believe is a confirmation swab from him so that request has gone in but tell us the rules around CODIS and when DNA can be taken and entered on CODIS. There are some cases where they can get a sample a DNA sample of somebody based just on an arrest but generally it is convicted offenders that are placed in CODIS but because of you know obviously there are people who are anybody on the sex offender registry should be in CODIS and anybody with a conviction it has to be a serious felony conviction I don't believe that you can get put in there with for a misdemeanor but you know but there are also when you when you think about VICAP you know it's not just the the DNA or the science but it's also the behavior that can link cases so basically with VICAP this is a program started by the FBI decades ago so that law enforcement officers across the country and we actually gave out computer systems and to law enforcement for free across the country so that they would log in their cases in VICAP so that when they have an unsolved case any kind of behavior that is unique any kind of crime that's unique any kind of crime that's that's just unsolved can be loaded into VICAP violent criminal apprehension program and then jurisdictions across the country and the FBI can look and say oh look today we have a case where there was an attempted abduction in Greensboro and you know you can actually look across the country to see if there were similar cars partial license plates particular behavior that was exhibited so that when an abduction does happen you can also look at all the attempted abductions in the area and see if that person or persons were active in other areas you could see that maybe that's where they took this victim too so you know it gives you ideas about directionality of where they would travel and what what video traffic videos and bank camera videos they might want to pull there's so many things now that technology helps us with and DNA is just part part of it but I think that Cody well Cody's only has the you know the DNA of convicted criminals but you can get a sample from an offender once he's arrested with a court order however they would not that DNA would not then be uploaded into code is for other people to you know compare it to unless there is a conviction I think is that what you were asking me yeah yeah I think I think because a lot of people are very surprised that so for example in the UK if you're arrested you can be DNA'd right and then it's searched against the database so you might have other offenses that we now know you committed whereas here it works slightly differently so one I think people are surprised that there's been a request for his DNA I think people probably expected that to have already been done the second part you know is that right Lisa I mean that's what I'm hearing from people that you just expect well just to confirm the DNA they already collected DNA from him randomly you know from discarded from the pizza yeah or something like to that effect the same thing happened in the Golden State Killer case it was a it was a Coke can that he just discarded or a drink a drink cup from you know a fast food restaurant but the fact is that you can you can compare a an arrestee's DNA to CODIS but there are totally different requirements to then upload that DNA there has to be a conviction before that DNA is then uploaded and generally available to all law enforcement across the country yeah I think that's very interesting once convicted because for me there's this just this big gap you know particularly if you've got unsolved crimes or you know in this case you've got 11 sets of human remains so it's almost like you have to wait until you know the end of the process and then you see whether it could be a match and I think that's a surprise to a lot of people that you know our system is definitely weighted towards protecting the defendant's rights there's no question about it surprise to a lot of people including me I should say yeah because you know that that wasn't my expectation and with Vicat we rolled that out in the UK gym and exactly the same way trying to behaviorally you know collect data from all around the UK to ensure that someone like Peter Sutcliffe didn't happen again you know and we know that there are gaps in cases being uploaded so that can be a challenge and you're trying to constantly plug those gaps not just with the cases but with the science and the science is a is it can be a very powerful tool so we'll see what happens with this case I think it's going to be a long time before it comes to trial given just the amount of information that has to be an evidence that needs to be processed I would imagine there's a warehouse right now with all of the things taken out of the house that's being labeled up all the evidence for processing that's going to take a very long time yeah definitely but there's also you know he has the right the defendant has the right to speedy trial if he requests it and of course in this case I think he's going to push for that the prosecution is probably going to delay it as long as possible but they only can do so much so it was weird in the case in Idaho where the defense immediately asked for a delay I would have thought the opposite would have happened that would have been a better strategy but you know they asked for the delay so that gives the prosecution more time to research and more time to evaluate evidence well what's fascinating on that case is the big nothing burger of the alibi that's just come out waiting all this time for his alibi to be delivered and the alibi is that he was driving around late at night as he often did driving around murders yeah turning his phone off at the precise time so I just think it's fascinating listening to some criminal defense lawyers twist and turn themselves into pretzels yeah to spin this into you know he's still innocent that is an alibi in the state of Idaho or to me an alibi is that someone cooperates you were or something cooperates you were where you say you are not just that you're driving around in the middle of the night but anyway there's a lot to play out in that case and there's a huge amount of spin and game playing going on not just by the lawyers but outside of that on social media by professionals who should know better in my opinion yeah she's lots of people weighing in on that well you can trust that if there's any more news breaking RCP is gonna jump on it Laura will definitely be the first person she's always texting me did you hear what happened I'm like what I didn't hear that I was asleep how do you know this but anyway if there's because I have a toddler who's not sleeping right now that's how I know this little sleep tracking cases but when they're the and whenever there's news breaking in this horrific case there's gonna be so much more to come and you should check in with us because we are gonna be weighing in on it and giving you these two brilliant minds perspective on the case so for now this is real crime profile signing out if you
